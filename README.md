# JS Stack Write
# creating a JavaScript-only GeoSpatial full stack with ArcGIS Online and ESRI JS

### build a fully functional front end that reads and writes to an AGOL database on the backend.
###  ArcGIS Online as a Backend Database
### The ArcGIS REST API:  is the bridge between your JavaScript frontend and the AGOL backend, enabling your application to query data, display it on a map, and send updates back to the database.
### Editing in GIS: adding, modifying, or deleting geospatial data within a dataset, altering the attributes of a feature, changing its location on a map, allowing users to interact directly with the geospatial data on AGOL. 
### Create a feature layer (point shapefile) on arcgis online websit, get the url, display on the webpage using Featurelayer()
### Enable edditing the point shapefile (adding more point, deleting, etc) and saving to the shapefile layer on agol.
### add a legend to the map
